Hi! I am `Chen Chu` (初晨), I am a first-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Southern California, advised by Professor [Cyrus Shahabi](https://infolab.usc.edu/). I am passionate about developing SOTA AI models to solve spatial problems, which involved trajectory modeling and predicting, spatial-temporal prediction, location encoding learning and AI based polygon/urban representation learning. 

Standing at the frontier that bridges spatial data science and Artificial Intelligence (AI), I believe the next turning point of spatial AI will be brought by a unified representation learning method of space and spatial entities.

Prior to my Ph.D., I earned my Master degree from State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System (LREIS), University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), where I was supervised by Prof. [Feng Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oeS87xoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and Assoc Prof. [Hengcai Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ys6nhTMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). 

My research interests include **Human Mobility Modeling**, **Spatially Explicit AI**, **Generative AI**. 

Please feel free to reach out to me!
