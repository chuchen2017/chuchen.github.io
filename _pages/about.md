Hi! I am `Chen Chu` (初晨), a Master student supervised by Prof. [Feng Lu](http://www.lreis.ac.cn/kyry/yjy/201609/t20160909_347829.html) and Assoc Prof. [Hengcai Zhang](http://www.lreis.ac.cn/kyry/fyjy/201705/t20170512_372517.html) at State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System (LREIS), Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research (IGSNRR), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). My research interests include **human mobility modeling**, **interpretable spatiotemporal prediction**, and **spatiotemporal data mining**.

Standing at the intersection of <b>GIScience</b> and <b>AI</b>, I believe the research in GeoAI has reached a turning point, and a unified `location encoding` method is the key to this transition. This method should be capable of representing all the prior knowledge from geographers, such as spatial heterogeneity. Simultaneously, it should be flexible, allowing scientists from other domains to incorporate this method into their research without needing adjustments, and easily achieve performance improvement. I am eager to develop such a method and elevate GeoAI to the next level.

To achieve this, I have equipped myself with fundamental skills. I enjoy exploring all types of spatial data and am enthusiastic about addressing the most important geography problems with advanced Artificial Intelligence methods.  Moreover, I prioritize the interpretability of the model and seek to understand how AI perceives our physical world. These ways of thinking are expected to guide the subsequent step of my research. I have articulated parts of my research concepts in several [papers](https://chuchen2017.github.io/publications/) during my master's studies.

So glad to announce that our research "TrajGDM: A New Trajectory Foundation Model for Simulating Human Mobility" is accepted by the `finalist of ACM SIGSPATIAL 2023 Student Research Competition`! We are going to Germany this November to give a speech on the conference!
