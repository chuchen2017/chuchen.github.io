One of our paper about location foundation model is in the finalist of <b>[SIGSPATIAL 2023 Student Research Competition](https://sigspatial2023.sigspatial.org/competition/)</b>, Hamburg, Germany. Thanks to the support of my supervisors, I could have the chance to attend the conference offline.

I give a presentation of the research at the main session of the conference. Where I believe I was the only Master student in the finalist.

Eventually, I won second place in the competition. It was a little pity, but encouraged me to do better next time.
