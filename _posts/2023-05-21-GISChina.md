I delivered an oral presentation about <b>Generative Trajectory Generation Model</b> at the [GIS conference 2023](https://gis2022.scievent.com/), which is one of the most influential GIScience conference in China.

The speech is given in the largest hall of the conference and attracts over a hundred researchers.
